##  SUMMARY
    Vaccination is one of the most effective tools in preventing infectious diseases. However, many people are unaware of the vital importance of vaccines or lack clear information about which ones are recommended for their specific situation. This article highlights an innovative desktop application, developed using the C# programming language, with the noble purpose of increasing awareness about vaccination. The application features a wide range of resources aimed at informing and guiding comprehensively. It provides well-founded details on the relevance of vaccines, giving users a solid understanding of how these preventive measures play a crucial role in protecting individual and collective health. With specific recommendations for pregnant and non-pregnant adults, the application adapts to each user's particular needs, ensuring personalized and effective guidance. Additionally, the application adopts an interactive and playful approach through an educational quiz. This engaging component seeks to enhance users' learning by promoting a dynamic and immersive understanding of immunization concepts. By challenging users with relevant questions and providing immediate feedback, the quiz not only reinforces acquired knowledge but also encourages ongoing engagement with the importance of vaccination.

##  INTRODUCTION
    Immunization through vaccines has been crucial in preventing infectious diseases throughout the history of medicine. Vaccines strengthen the human immune system, providing protection against pathogens, a significant achievement. According to Orenstein and Ahmed (2017), vaccination saves lives. Despite advancements, the accessible dissemination of information on immunization and vaccination remains challenging. The current technological revolution enables the creation of interactive educational applications addressing these challenges. The increasing prevalence of electronic devices and internet accessibility facilitates the interactive dissemination of essential information. This work presents a desktop application in C#, aiming to raise awareness about vaccines and guide specific population groups. Through the creation of this application, the aim is to contribute to the amplification of societal awareness regarding the relevance of vaccines as a crucial tool in preventing infectious diseases, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 3: "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." The educational and interactive approach proposed by the application holds the potential to deepen people's understanding of the individual and collective benefits of immunization, while also providing specific information for more vulnerable groups, such as pregnant adults. Throughout this article, the technical, educational, and potential impact aspects of the application will be explored, highlighting its contribution to public health promotion and the dissemination of accurate and evidence-based information on the importance of vaccines.

##  OBJECTIVES
    Through the creation of this application, the aim is to contribute to the expansion of societal awareness regarding the relevance of vaccines as a crucial tool in preventing infectious diseases.

##  METHODOLOGY
    This section describes the methodology employed in developing the desktop application aimed at promoting awareness of the importance of vaccines. The process of creating the application was structured into sequential stages, ranging from initial research to the final implementation of the educational product. To support the approach, a review of specialized and scientifically relevant literature was conducted. Regarding the practical development phase, the following tools were used: a) Canva: A graphic design platform that allows users to create graphics for social media, presentations, infographics, posters, and other visual content; b) Microsoft Visual Studio: A Microsoft integrated development environment used for software development, especially focused on the .NET Framework and languages such as Visual Basic, C, C#, and F#; c) .NET Framework: A unified platform for developing and executing systems and applications. Any code generated for ".NET" can be executed on devices that have the platform's framework.

##   DEVELOPMENT
    The development of the educational application followed a staged approach, focusing on raising awareness about the importance of vaccines: a) Research and Content: A comprehensive research on vaccines and immunization was conducted, gathering relevant information for each section of the application; b) Structure and Functionality: The structure of the application was defined, organizing the sections and functionalities necessary to present the content in an accessible manner; c) Interface Design: An attractive and intuitive visual design was created for the interface, selecting coherent colors, graphic elements, and typography; d) Technical Development: Using Microsoft Visual Studio, the functionality of the application was implemented, allowing access to and interaction with the information; e) Educational Quiz: An interactive quiz containing questions about vaccines was developed, providing a playful approach to learning and reinforcing knowledge.
